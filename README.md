Social Media App Description
Development Background:
In the second semester of my CS program, I developed a social media application using the Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++. This project showcases my ability to combine multimedia handling with robust software design practices.

Key Features:

User Interface:

The app features a custom graphical user interface (GUI) built with SFML, offering a visually appealing and intuitive layout. The interface includes components such as buttons, text boxes, and icons, designed to enhance user interaction.
User Accounts:

Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles. The account management system includes functionalities for editing personal information, updating profile pictures, and changing passwords.
Friend Management:

The app allows users to send, accept, and decline friend requests. Friends are displayed in a dedicated section, where users can view their profiles, status updates, and mutual friends.
Post and Feed System:

Users can create posts that appear in a chronological feed. Each post can include text and images, with the ability to like and comment. The feed dynamically updates, showing posts from friends and popular content across the platform.
Messaging:

A real-time messaging system lets users communicate privately with friends. The messaging interface includes chat windows, message timestamps, and support for emojis.
Notifications:

The app features a notification system that alerts users to new friend requests, messages, likes, and comments. Notifications are displayed in real-time, ensuring users stay engaged with ongoing activities.
Search Functionality:

Users can search for other users, posts, and hashtags, making it easy to find and connect with friends or discover trending content.
Security and Privacy:

Implementing basic security measures, the app ensures that user data is securely stored and managed. Privacy settings allow users to control who can view their posts and send them friend requests.
Object-Oriented Design:

I structured the application using OOP principles, with classes representing core entities such as Users, Posts, Friends, and Messages. Inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism are employed to create a modular and maintainable codebase.
Technologies Used:

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library): Used for handling graphics, window management, and event handling, providing a smooth and interactive user experience.
C++ with OOP: I developed the app in C++, leveraging OOP concepts to structure the program efficiently and promote code reuse.
Learning Outcome:
Through the development of this social media app, I gained practical experience in software development, GUI design, and the application of OOP principles in a real-world project. This project reflects my ability to tackle complex challenges and create functional, user-oriented software.
